        <p>Abstract</p>
<p>The decline of biodiversity has become one of the most important problem we are facing, and habitat fragmentation has been considered an essential threat for species. However, the accurate effect of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is still controversial. In this report, I review on the current knowledge, and analyze the possible effects from both size with theoretical models and empirical cases. In the end, I discuss in general the significance of theoretical ecology in conservation biology</p>
<p>I. Current knowledge of habitat fragmentation and its effect</p>
<pre><code>The world where we now live is developing at an incredible speed. Beyond this rapid development, however, the ecological problems we are facing also become more severe than ever. One of these problems that has drew a growing attention is the great and accelerating loss of biodiversity. Among the various threatens species are under, habitat destructions are usually stated as of most importance in conservation studies.
Habitat fragmentation was generally defined in a 2002 paper as “the discontinuity, resulting from a given set of mechanisms, in the spatial distribution of resources and conditions present in an area at a given scale that affects occupancy, reproduction, or survival in a particular species” . This term and the term “habitat loss” describe a couple of concepts that are frequently mentioned in relevant researches. The first elegant and general ecological theory discussing the effect of habitat change to biodiversity was offered by MacArthur and Wilson. In their book “The Theory of Island Biogeography”, they predicted that the smaller and more isolated (fragmented) a habitat is, the fewer species it will support . Though being one of the founding tenets of the field of conservation biology, the island biogeography later gave place to metapopulation theory, which focused on only one species and removed the persistent mainland habitat and emphasized the importance of dispersal  .</code></pre><p>The two theories above both predict a negative effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. For habitat loss, this negative effect is universally accepted, but the effect of habitat fragmentation has long been under debate. For example, a following theory named metacommunity theory which takes the interaction of species into consideration shown that, a patchy environment can promote coexistence between predators and prey by providing refuges for the victim species .<br>Part of this controversy comes from the difficulties of separating the effect of habitat fragmentation from that of habitat loss, considering these two processes have a large possibility of co-occurrence. And there is also a general pattern of biological impoverishment of fragmented habitats compared with more intact ones. In addition, the distinct definition of terms and measurement of empirical cases make it hard to compare different theories and studies . On the other hands, these limits also provide space for different perspectives from theoretical and empirical analysis. We will discuss them in detail in the following parts.</p>
<p>II. Theoretical analysis: possible positive or negative effect of habitat fragmentation</p>
<pre><code>Is the effect of habitat fragmentation positive or negative on biodiversity? This problem is summarized as the SLOSS problem, with “SLOSS” standing for “the single large or several small”. An article in 2002 constructed a theoretical model to address this problem .
The model is generally based on the metapopulation theory, considering the dynamics of a single species on spatially homogeneous patches. The total amount A0 of habitat available is fixed, ruling out the effect of habitat loss, and the number of patches n = A0 / A, where A means area of habitat patches. As is obvious, n is negatively correlated with A, so there should be either a single large patch, or multiple small patches. The author estimated which condition is the optimal one for biodiversity with two measurement, the expected time to metapopulation extinction, and the metapopulation capacity.
What the author found was that the habitat fragmentation in this model (represented by several small patches) can exhibited positive or negative effect under different conditions. The conditions are mainly defined by three parameters, , , and A0. The species parameter  is defined as the ratio of the extinction and colonization rate parameters,  = e/c. The patch area scaling factor  integrates the effect of patch area on metapopulation dynamics.
Based on a series of theoretical calculations, the meta population capacity can be approximately given by:</code></pre><p>M=n1-A0  f(d)<br>    This equation suggested that if  &gt; 1, SL is the optimal strategy for maximizing M , whereas   &lt; 1 would lead to the SS strategy. This means if the metapopulation capacity of a patch network grows with patch area faster than linearly, then the patch size should be of priority and vice versa.<br>    Meanwhile, the expected time to metapopulation is given by:</p>
<pre><code>This equation indicated that when  &lt; 1, the SS strategy is optimal, while the condition can be much more complex when  &gt; 1. The optimal strategy in this case falls between SS and SL strategy, and can be concluded as follow: The optimal size of habitat patches increases (and thus their number decreases) with increasing patch area scaling factor  and , but with decreasing A0. </code></pre><p>Overall, the habitat fragmentation has both positive and negative effects on species persistence in this model. A high number of habitat patches (a more fragmented habitat) can help the system gain the advantages of risk spreading, but it also leads to smaller patches, which may result in smaller capacity. It depends on the characteristic of the species (how sensitive to patch size and how easy to disperse etc.) to decide which the better strategy is. Noted that in this model, only one species is considered, so species interactions are not taken into consideration, and the model may need further development to better fit the reality.</p>
<p>III. Empirical analysis: different effect of fragmentation and corridor in real cases</p>
<pre><code>The empirical literatures about the effect of fragmentation are of huge size, and are across different scale, area and taxon. Many studies support a negative effect of smaller patch size and spatial discontinuity. For example, in a 2016 article, researchers found that in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, larger fragments had more amphibian species, more integer communities and a larger diversity of reproductive modes than smaller ones. In addition, the values were higher for all diversity measures in continuous forest sites compared to fragments . However, there are also studies suggesting that the fragmentation may not matter to biodiversity. One research analyzed the species diversities of plants, tenebrionid beetles and carabid beetles in a highly fragmented Mediterranean scrub landscape. After decoupling the effect of degree of fragmentation from that of area loss, fragmentation by itself seems not to have influenced the number of species . In another research conducted in agricultural landscapes in Southern Judea Lowlands, Israel, spider diversity even increased as fragmentation increased . These complicated and diverse result may be due to the extrapolation of a small-scale mechanism to a large-scale pattern, or ignorance of other mechanisms, especially those acting at landscape scales, as suggested by later articles .</code></pre><p>IV. Significance of theoretical ecology in conservation biology</p>
<pre><code>The ecology in the real world is very complex, with numerous parameters, factors and biological processes getting involved. In this case, it’s hard to decide what the best conservation management is without the foundation of theoretical ecology. If we make decision based on intuition, the result can be helpless or even disastrous. For example, the removement of wolves from Yellowstone National Park eventually led to the broke down of the original ecosystem, which is counterintuitive at the beginning. Theoretical ecology can give us a more comprehensive understanding toward the environment and ecosystem, predict the possible balancing point of state transit, and help us to find the most effective way to manage and conserve our home planet. </code></pre><p>Reference</p>
